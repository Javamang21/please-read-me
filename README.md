# Project Name: please-read-me
## Description
This assignment was from the UCF coding bootcamp and was the weekly assignment for module 9. 
The goal was to create a professional readme.md file only using Node.js. We had to create a series of questions 
that will allow a user to generate a readme.md file from any command line interface.

Anytime a developer or a group of developers sets out to create something it takes time. 
A common phrase you may here a lot "Rome wasn't built in a day" has never been more accurate when it comes to a coder.
That is where this readme.md file generator comes into play. 
- The purpose of this project is too create a professional readme file without having to spend quality time to do it.
This takes the leg work out of creating the most important file on your repo. Because first impressions leave a lasting impact on everyone.
